## Unique Design Choices & Creativity

### Niche Focus
By targeting guitar enthusiasts, the app is uniquely tailored to a specific audience. Every design choiceâ€”from product layout to imageryâ€”reflects the love for music and guitars.

### Color Palette
- Inspired by the **natural wooden tones** of guitars.
- **Dark Brown** (`#5D4037`) used for buttons and headers to represent mahogany/rosewood finishes.
- **Light Brown** (`#D7CCC8`) and **White** for backgrounds and contrast, giving the app a clean, organic look.

### Typography
- Bold sans-serif fonts for headers to command attention.
- Clean, readable fonts for body text to enhance user experience.

### Iconography & Branding
- Custom icons representing guitars, shopping carts, and user profiles
- Splash screen with a musical note icon on a black background for minimal, elegant branding

### Innovative UI/UX Touches
- Interactive product selectors for color, size, and quantity
- Fully responsive layout using `MediaQuery`
- Use of `PageView` for a clean image carousel
- Modular structure for better code reusability

## Challenges Faced & Solutions

### 1. **Showing the add to cart items to the Cart Screen**
- **Problem**: Managing cart state and product selections without persistent storage.
- **Solution**: Implemented an in-memory cart system using `CartService` and `setState()` for state updates. Structured the app to ensure UI consistently reflects the current state.

### 2. **UI Consistency on Different Devices**
- **Problem**: Ensuring that UI looks consistent across various screen sizes.
- **Solution**: Used `Flexible`, `Expanded`, and `MediaQuery` extensively to create responsive layouts. Spacing and padding were adjusted dynamically.
